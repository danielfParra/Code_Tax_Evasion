        You have been assigned to the role of <strong>Player A</strong>
        and you will be matched with a
        group of <strong>3 Players B</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <input id="info_button1" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button1, paragraph1);" />
    </p>

    <div id="paragraph1" class="hidden-paragraph">

    <p>
        <strong>Players B</strong> will participate in a game in which they
        will perform the same encoding task you have done in Part 1.
        They, as well as you, will be paid for doing the task.
    </p>

        <p>
    <input id="info_button2" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button2, paragraph2);" />

     <p>
        <strong>Players B</strong> will be asked to pay a {{Constants.tax_rate}}% tax on
         their self-reported earnings.
     </p>

    <p>
         Taxes collected will be <strong>doubled</strong> and given to the organisation
         <strong>Keep Britain Tidy</strong> at the end of this study.
         The money will be used to support its activities to reduce litter,
         improve local places, and prevent waste.
     </p>

<p>
    As <strong>Player A</strong>, you will participate in a lottery for a prize of
    <strong>{{Constants.money_to_take}} from the collected taxes</strong>.
    If you win the prize, the money will be deducted before being doubled and transferred to
    <strong>Keep Britain Tidy</strong>.
</p>
     <p>
         Given that each <strong>Player B</strong> will participate in the practice round for sure,
         the collected taxes will be at least {{Constants.money_to_take}} regardless of what each
         Player B will decide to report.
     </p>

     <p>
         <i>The outcome of the lottery,  what ever it is,
             <strong>will not affect Player B's earnings</strong>.</i>
