        You have been assigned to the role of <strong>Player B</strong> and you are part of a group of 3
        participants (including yourself). The 3 members of your group are all <strong>Players B</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <input id="info_button1" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button1, paragraph1);" />

        <div id="paragraph1" class="hidden-paragraph">
    <p> All members of your group participated in Part 1 and earned an income from it.</p>

    <p> We now ask you to report the income you earned in Part 1.
        At a minimum, your report should be the {{ Constants.payoff_trial }}
        you earned in the practice round.
        <strong>The income that you report will be taxed
         at the rate of {{Constants.tax_rate}}%</strong>.

    <p> The other Players B in your group will also be asked to report
        their incomes for taxation purposes.
        Your income report, as well as the income reports of the
        other players in your group, is completely private.
        <strong>You won't know their income report, and they won't know yours</strong>.

     <p>

    <p>
         Taxes collected will be <strong>doubled</strong> and given to the organisation
         <strong>Keep Britain Tidy</strong> at the end of this study.
         The money will be used to support its activities to reduce litter,
         improve local places, and prevent waste.

    <p> Your group is going to be randomly matched with <strong>1 Player A out of 10 Players A</strong>.
        In a previous study, the 10 Players A have already been included in a lottery where they could
        receive {{Constants.money_to_take}} from the collected taxes of the
        group of Players B they are going to be matched with.
        </p>

    <p> Participants A do not choose whether to participate or not in the lottery. They are all included
        in the lottery by default. They could win {{Constants.money_to_take}} from the collected
        taxes before these are doubled and donated to Keep Britain Tidy.
        These {{Constants.money_to_take}} corresponds to the taxes paid
        by your group members from their earnings in the practice round in Part 1.

         One Participant A of the 10 presented in the picture will be randomly selected
