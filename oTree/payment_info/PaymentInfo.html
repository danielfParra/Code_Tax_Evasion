      For your participation in this study, you will receive
      {{ Prolific_fixed_payoff }} on your Prolific account
      <b>{{ participant.label }}</b> which include the completion fee of {{ Constants.completion_fee }}
      and the {{ trial_payoff }} from the practice round of the encryption task.
      </p>
    <p>
      Based on your decisions you will
      receive the additional {{ payoff }} in a form of a bonus after
      the end of the study. The bonus payment might take a few more hours to reach you,
      so we ask you to be patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally you may earn a bonus payment from part 2 of the survey.
      To determine your bonus payment, we need to collect all participants' responses
      to calculate the prize. We will send a message to all participants indicating
      what the most selected response for this situation was, along with the payment, if any.
