        You have being assigned to the role of <strong>Player A</strong> and you are matched with a
        group of <strong>3 Players B</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Players B</strong> will participate in a game in which they perform the same encoding task
        you did in Part 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        They, as well as you, will earn {{Constants.payoff_trial}} for the practice round and
        {{Constants.piece_rate}} for each word they encode correctly in 5 minutes.
    </p>

     <p>
        <strong>Players B</strong> are asked to pay a {{Constants.tax_rate}}% tax on their self-reported earnings.
     </p>

     <p>
         Taxes collected will be <strong>doubled</strong> and given to the organisation
         <strong>Keep Britain Tidy</strong> at the end of this study.
         The money will be used to support its actions of reducing litter, improving local places,
         and preventing waste.
     </p>

     <p>
         As <strong>Player A</strong>, you will decide <strong>whether to take {{Constants.money_to_take}} or not
         from the collected taxes</strong> before being doubled and transferred to
         <strong>Keep Britain Tidy</strong>.
     </p>
     <p>
        Given that <strong>Player B</strong> earn at least {{Constants.payoff_trial}}, the collected taxes
         will have at least {{Constants.money_to_take}}.
     </p>

     <p>
         <i>Your decision, whichever it is, does not affect Players B's earnings.</i>
