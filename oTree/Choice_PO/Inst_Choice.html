        You have being assigned to the role of <b>Player A</b> and you are matched with a
        group of <b>3 Players B</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Players B</b> wil participate in a game in which they perform the same encoding task
        you did in Part 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        They, as well as you, will earn {{Constants.payoff_trial}} for the practice round and
        {{Constants.piece_rate}} for each word they encode correctly in 5 minutes.
    </p>

     <p>
        <b>Players B</b> are asked to pay a {{Constants.tax_rate}}% tax on their self-reported income.
     </p>

     <p>
         Taxes collected will be <b>doubled</b> and given to the organisation
         <b>Keep Britain Tidy</b> at the end of this study.
         The money will be used to support its actions of reducing litter, improving local places,
         and preventing waste.
     </p>

     <p>
         As <b>Player A</b>, you will decide <b>whether to take {{Constants.money_to_take}} or not
         from the collected taxes</b> before being doubled and transferred to
         <b>Keep Britain Tidy</b>.
     </p>
     <p>
        Given that <b>Player B</b> earn at least {{Constants.payoff_trial}}, the collected taxes
         will have at least {{Constants.money_to_take}} for sure.
