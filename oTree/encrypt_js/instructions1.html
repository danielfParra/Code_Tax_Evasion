        Decoding Task
    </h3>
    <p>
        You will perform an encoding task. Specifically, you will be given
        sequences of three random capital letters. We call the three letters
        combination a “Word” for simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to allocate a number to each capital letter.
        The encoding code can be found in the table below the corresponding letter.
        For each Word, the decoding table changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For illustration, consider the following screenshot:
    </p>

    <div class="card" style="width: 100%;">
        <img src="{{ static 'screenshot.PNG' }}"/>
        <div class="card-body">
        </div>
    </div>
<p></p>
    <p>
        In this example, the three capital letters: “E”, “T” and “K” have to be encoded.
        The solution follows immediately from the encoding table:

    <ul>
        <li>The encryption code for “E” is 627 (already entered by the participant)</li>
        <li>The encryption code for “T” is 784 (already entered by the participant)</li>
        <li>The encryption code for “K” is 333 (not entered yet by the participant)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You will have 5 minutes to encode as many words into numbers as possible correctly.
        Note that each letter must be encoded correctly to continue to the next Word.
    </p>
    <p>
        After completing all the letters of a Word, click on submit.
        If the three letter codes are correct, a new word and a new encoding table will appear.
        Otherwise, you will see an alert informing you that you have some mistakes in your encoding.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to check and correct the codes until the Word is correct.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each new encoding table is randomly generated in two steps:

        <ol>
    <li> The computer program randomly selects in the table a new set of
        three-digit numbers to be used for the capital letters encoding.</li>
    <li>
        Additionally, the computer program shuffles the position
        of the capital letters in the table. Please note that the program always uses
        all 26 capital letters of the alphabet. </li>
</ol>
