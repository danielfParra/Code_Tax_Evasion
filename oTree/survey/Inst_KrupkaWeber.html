    <p>
    You will read descriptions of a series of situations on the following screens.
    These descriptions correspond to situations in which a Participant B in this
    study must make an income-report decision. The description of each situation
    will include several possible choices available to Participant B.
    </p>

    <p>
    <input id="info_button1" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button1, paragraph1);" />
    </p>

    <div id="paragraph1" class="hidden-paragraph">

    <p>
        After you read the description of the situation, you will be asked to evaluate
        the different possible income-report choices available to Participant B.
        You will decide, for each of the possible income-report options, whether
        taking that choice would be "socially appropriate" and "consistent with
        moral or proper social behavior" or "socially inappropriate" and "inconsistent
        with moral or proper social behavior."
    </p>

    <p>
        By socially appropriate, we mean behavior that most people agree is the "correct" or "ethical"
        thing to do. Another way to think about what we mean is that if Participant B were to
        select a socially inappropriate choice, someone else might be angry at Participant B.
        We would like you to answer based on your opinions of what constitutes socially
        appropriate or socially inappropriate behavior in each of your responses.

    <h4> How your additional earnings in this survey are determined? </h4>
<br>
     <p>
         You will assess the possible income-report choices of participant B in four different
         situations. At the end of this study, we will randomly select one of the four situations.
         For this situation, we will also randomly choose one of the choices that Participant B
         could make.
     </p>
            <p>
         We will check which response was selected by the most participants in this study for the
         selected choice. If you give the same response as the most frequently provided by the
         other participants, you will receive Â£0.25. This amount will be paid to you in the next
         few days once we collect all participants' responses to calculate the prize.
     </p>
         <p>
         We will send a message to all participants indicating what the most selected response
             for this situation was, along with your payment, if any.
         </p>
